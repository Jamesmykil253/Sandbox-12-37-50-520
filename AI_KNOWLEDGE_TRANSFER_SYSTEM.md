# AI KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER SYSTEM
## For Unity Multiplayer Platformer Project

### ðŸ“‹ PROJECT STATUS TRACKER

#### âœ… COMPLETED SYSTEMS
- [x] **Combat System**: Basic + empowered projectiles working
- [x] **Stealth System**: Transparency mechanics functional
- [x] **State Machine**: Player states (Idle/Grounded/Airborne) operational
- [x] **Networking**: Photon PUN 2 synchronization active
- [x] **Goal Zone System**: PlayerScoring integration complete
- [x] **Visibility System**: Event-driven transparency control

#### ðŸ”§ RECENT BUG FIXES APPLIED
1. **PlayerController.cs:158-162**: Added visibility event subscriptions
2. **PlayerController.cs:354-374**: Added HandleVisibilityChange() and UpdateVisibility()
3. **PlayerCombat.cs:418**: Added basicProjectilePrefab field
4. **PlayerCombat.cs:517-555**: Added FireBasicProjectile() method
5. **StealthGrass.cs**: Removed debug logging (lines cleaned)

#### ðŸŽ¯ CRITICAL CONFIGURATION CHECKLIST
- [ ] **Player Prefab**: Verify PlayerScoring component exists
- [ ] **PlayerCombat**: Assign BaiscProjectile.prefab to basicProjectilePrefab field
- [ ] **Layer Setup**: Enemies on Layer 7, attackLayerMask = 128
- [ ] **Materials**: Debug material assigned for transparency effects

### ðŸ¤– AI DELEGATION FRAMEWORK

#### **When Another AI Takes Over:**

##### 1. **IMMEDIATE ASSESSMENT** (First 5 minutes)
```bash
# Run these checks in order:
1. Read CLAUDE.md for project context
2. Read AI_KNOWLEDGE_TRANSFER_SYSTEM.md (this file)  
3. Read COMPLETE_PROJECT_SCRIPTS.txt for code reference
4. Verify Assets/_Project/Scripts/ structure exists
5. Check Unity Console for current errors
```

##### 2. **SYSTEM VALIDATION** (Next 10 minutes)
```bash
# Key files to verify:
Assets/_Project/Scripts/Characters/PlayerController.cs (lines 354-374)
Assets/_Project/Scripts/Characters/PlayerCombat.cs (line 418, 471-474)
Assets/_Project/Scripts/Interactables/StealthGrass.cs (clean, no debug logs)
Assets/_Project/Scripts/Characters/PlayerScoring.cs (OnEnterGoalZone method)
```

##### 3. **TESTING PROTOCOL**
- **Combat Test**: Fire 3 attacks, verify 3rd is empowered (boosted projectile)
- **Stealth Test**: Walk into grass, verify transparency (30% alpha)
- **Goal Zone Test**: Walk in/out, verify healing and zone detection
- **Network Test**: Connect 2+ players, verify synchronization

### ðŸš€ KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER CHECKLIST

#### **Before Starting Work:**
- [ ] Read all three documentation files (CLAUDE.md, this file, COMPLETE_PROJECT_SCRIPTS.txt)
- [ ] Understand the 4-agent delegation system (@AssetAuditor, @DesignConsultant, @CodeArtisan, @ArchiveKeeper)
- [ ] Verify project structure and dependencies
- [ ] Check Unity Console for current state

#### **During Work:**
- [ ] Use TodoWrite tool to track all tasks
- [ ] Mark tasks as in_progress before starting
- [ ] Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing
- [ ] Document any new issues discovered
- [ ] Update this file with new findings

#### **Before Transferring to Next AI:**
- [ ] Complete current todo list
- [ ] Update "Current Session Goals" section above
- [ ] Document any new configurations required
- [ ] Note any unfinished business in "Next AI Notes"
- [ ] Commit changes if explicitly requested by user

---

### ðŸ“š ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE BASE

#### **Core Architecture Patterns:**
- **Component-Based**: RequireComponent attributes enforce dependencies
- **Event-Driven**: C# Action events for loose coupling (OnGrassStatusChanged, OnRevealStatusChanged)
- **State Machine**: IState/ITransition interfaces with StateMachine coordinator
- **Network Authority**: Master Client for AI, individual ownership for players
- **Performance**: Object pooling, minimal GC allocation, 60+ FPS target

#### **Key Technical Concepts:**
- **Empowerment System**: Every 3rd attack (_basicAttackCounter >= 3) fires boosted projectile
- **Stealth Mechanics**: isInGrass && !isRevealed = 30% transparency 
- **Network Sync**: IPunObservable + RPCs for critical state changes
- **Layer Collision**: Layer 7 (128 bits) for enemy targeting
- **Material Instancing**: _debugMaterialInstance for per-player transparency

#### **Common Pitfalls:**
- **Edit Tool Issues**: Always provide sufficient context to avoid "Found 2+ matches"
- **Network Timing**: Check PhotonNetwork.InRoom before RPCs
- **Component Dependencies**: PlayerController requires 4 components, always verify
- **File Paths**: Use absolute paths, prefer existing files over creating new ones

---

### ðŸ”§ TROUBLESHOOTING QUICK REFERENCE

#### **Transparency Not Working:**
- Check PlayerController.cs:354-374 methods exist
- Verify event subscriptions in Awake() method
- Confirm _debugMaterialInstance is not null

#### **Basic Attacks Not Firing:**
- Check PlayerCombat.cs:418 basicProjectilePrefab assigned
- Verify FireBasicProjectile() method exists (lines 517-555)
- Confirm else-if logic at line 471-474

#### **Goal Zone Not Responding:**
- Verify PlayerScoring component on Player prefab
- Check GoalZone.cs calls player.Scoring methods
- Confirm trigger colliders enabled

#### **Network Desync:**
- Check PhotonView components on all networked objects
- Verify IPunObservable implementations sending correct data
- Confirm RPC targets (RpcTarget.All vs RpcTarget.Others)

- **Animation System**: Attack, movement, and state transition animations
- **UI Enhancement**: Health bars, XP indicators, score displays

#### **Phase 2: Advanced Features (4-8 weeks)**
- **Power-Up System**: Temporary abilities, stat boosts, special items
- **Advanced AI**: Behavior trees, group tactics, dynamic difficulty
- **Environmental Hazards**: Traps, moving platforms, destructible terrain
- **Objective Modes**: Capture the flag, king of the hill, elimination

#### **Phase 3: Polish & Optimization (8-12 weeks)**
- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch controls, performance scaling
- **Advanced Networking**: Server authority, anti-cheat measures
- **Content Expansion**: Multiple levels, character classes, customization
- **Analytics & Telemetry**: Performance monitoring, player behavior tracking
