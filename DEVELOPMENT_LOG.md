**Status:** COMPLETED âœ…

#### Core Systems Implemented:
1. **State Machine Framework** (`/Assets/_Project/Scripts/State Machine/`)
   - Generic state machine engine with transition support
   - Interface-based design (IState, IPredicate, ITransition)
   - Used by both Player and Enemy AI systems

2. **Component Architecture** (`/Assets/_Project/Scripts/Characters/`)
   - Modular component system for player functionality
   - `PlayerController` as main orchestrator
   - `PlayerMovement`, `PlayerCombat`, `PlayerScoring` as specialized components
   - `CharacterStats` for shared character data

3. **Input System Integration** (`/Assets/_Project/Scripts/Core/InputReader.cs`)
   - Unity's New Input System implementation
   - ScriptableObject-based input reader
   - Event-driven input handling

#### Key Technical Decisions:
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each component handles specific functionality

   - RPC-based damage and combat systems
   - Networked object spawning for projectiles and loot

2. **Authority Management**
   - Master Client handles AI logic and authoritative actions
   - Client-side prediction for responsive movement
   - Server reconciliation for critical game state

#### Networking Fixes Applied:
- **Enemy AI Authority:** Only Master Client controls enemy behavior
- **Damage System:** RPC-based damage dealing with view ID tracking  
- **Object Spawning:** PhotonNetwork.Instantiate for shared objects
- **Offline/Online Compatibility:** Systems work in both modes

### Phase 3: Game Mechanics Implementation
**Status:** COMPLETED âœ…

#### Combat System:
1. **Damage Calculation** (`CombatCalculator.cs`)
   - PokÃ©mon Unite-inspired damage formula
   - Level and stat-based scaling
   - Critical hit system with configurable rates
   - Empowered attacks (every 3rd attack)

2. **Projectile System** (`Projectiles.cs`)
   - Physics-based projectile movement
   - Target-seeking for empowered attacks
   - Layer-mask based hit detection

#### Scoring System:
1. **Coin Collection Mechanics**
   - Collision-based coin pickup
   - Score accumulation and banking
   - XP rewards for scoring

2. **Goal Zone System** (`GoalZone.cs`)
   - Team-based goal zones with healing
   - Time-based scoring mechanics
   - Visual feedback for scoring states

### Phase 4: AI and Enemy Systems  
**Status:** COMPLETED âœ…

#### Enemy AI Implementation:
1. **State-Based AI** (`EnemyAIController.cs`)
   - Idle, Combat, and Return states
   - NavMesh-based pathfinding
   - Aggro system with stealth mechanics

2. **Stealth Mechanics** (`StealthGrass.cs`)
   - Grass-based hiding system
   - Reveal mechanics on attack/damage
   - Team-specific stealth rules

#### AI Behavior Features:
- **Leash System:** Enemies return to spawn when player is too far
- **Combat Targeting:** Automatic target acquisition and attack execution
- **Loot Dropping:** Coin drops on enemy death

### Phase 5: Camera and Visual Systems
**Status:** COMPLETED âœ…

#### Camera System:
1. **Multi-Position Camera** (`CameraController.cs`)
   - Multiple camera angles/positions
   - Smooth camera transitions
   - Input-based camera cycling

2. **Visual Feedback Systems**
   - State-based material color changes
   - Scoring visual indicators
   - Debug color coding for AI states

## Current Project Status

### âœ… Completed Systems:
- Core movement and character control
- State machine framework
- Multiplayer networking (PUN 2)
- Combat system with damage calculation
- Enemy AI with pathfinding
- Scoring and objective system  
- Camera system with multiple views
- Input system integration
- Stealth mechanics

### ðŸ”§ Areas for Improvement:
- UI system not fully implemented
- Sound system minimal
- Animation system present but underutilized
- Performance optimization needed for large multiplayer sessions
- Mobile platform optimization

### ðŸ“Š Code Quality Metrics:
- **Total C# Scripts:** ~60+ custom scripts
- **Architecture Pattern:** Component-based with State Machine
- **Code Organization:** Well-structured namespace usage (`Platformer`)
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive null checks and safety measures
- **Documentation:** Inline comments and XML documentation

## Technical Architecture

### Core Dependencies:
```json
{
  "unity": "6000.1.4f1",
  "photon-pun2": "included",
  "input-system": "1.14.1",
  "ai-navigation": "2.0.8",
  "multiplayer-tools": "2.2.5",
  "universal-render-pipeline": "17.1.0"
}
```

### Key Design Patterns:
1. **State Machine Pattern:** Player and Enemy behavior
2. **Component Pattern:** Modular character functionality  
3. **Observer Pattern:** Event-driven communication
4. **Singleton Pattern:** GameManager for game state
5. **Object Pool Pattern:** Used for projectiles (ready for expansion)

### Performance Considerations:
- NavMesh-based pathfinding for AI
- Object pooling ready for implementation
- Efficient collision detection using layer masks
- Master Client authority to reduce network traffic

## Known Issues & Resolutions

### âœ… RESOLVED: Networking Synchronization
**Issue:** AI and combat actions not synchronized across clients  
**Resolution:** Implemented Master Client authority with RPC-based actions

### âœ… RESOLVED: Component References  
**Issue:** Missing component references causing null reference exceptions  
**Resolution:** Added comprehensive null checks and safety validations

### âœ… RESOLVED: State Transition Conflicts
**Issue:** State machine transitions causing conflicts  
**Resolution:** Implemented priority-based transition evaluation

### âœ… RESOLVED: Input System Integration
**Issue:** Input events not properly bound to actions  
**Resolution:** Fixed SetCallbacks method to target specific action maps

## Development Best Practices Applied

1. **Modular Design:** Each system is self-contained and loosely coupled
2. **Error Prevention:** Extensive null checking and validation
3. **Performance Optimization:** Efficient algorithms and data structures
4. **Code Readability:** Clear naming conventions and documentation
5. **Version Control Friendly:** Proper file organization and separation

## Future Development Roadmap

### Immediate Priorities:
1. **UI System Enhancement:** Main menu, HUD, and game UI
2. **Audio Integration:** Sound effects and music system
3. **Animation Polish:** Character animations and transitions
4. **Mobile Optimization:** Touch controls and performance tuning

### Long-term Goals:
1. **Advanced AI:** More sophisticated enemy behaviors
2. **Power-up System:** Temporary ability enhancements
3. **Map Editor:** Level creation tools
4. **Spectator Mode:** Observer functionality for matches
5. **Ranked Matchmaking:** Competitive play systems
