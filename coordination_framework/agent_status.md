## 🔄 Inter-Agent Communication Log

### Recent Communications

**2025-08-06 14:30** - Asset Auditor → Design Consultant  
> ✅ **Analysis Complete:** Combat system audit finished. Key findings: Current PlayerCombat.cs is well-structured for extension. Recommended enhancement points include ability system integration, combo detection, and enhanced visual feedback. Performance impact should be minimal with proper implementation.

**2025-08-06 14:45** - Design Consultant → Asset Auditor  
> 📝 **Design Clarification Request:** Need confirmation on network RPC requirements for ability synchronization. Also, what's the maximum recommended ability cooldown precision for network efficiency?

**2025-08-06 15:00** - Asset Auditor → Design Consultant  
> ✅ **Technical Response:** RPC requirements confirmed - use existing damage RPC pattern. Cooldown precision: 0.1s minimum for network efficiency. Existing PhotonView can handle up to 20 RPCs/second per player safely.

**2025-08-06 15:15** - Design Consultant → Code Artisan  
> 📋 **Implementation Preview:** Initial ability system design complete. Core architecture: AbilitySystem component with scriptable ability definitions. ComboManager tracks sequence and timing. Will have complete specs in ~2 hours.

**2025-08-06 15:30** - Archive Keeper → All Agents  
> 📚 **Documentation Templates Ready:** Combat system documentation templates prepared. Include: developer guide template, ability reference format, troubleshooting checklist. Ready for content when implementation is complete.
